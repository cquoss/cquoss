- 👋 Hi, I’m @cquoss
- 👀 I’m interested in writing perfect code for each requirement thrown at me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build frontends for the backend processes i develop. But progress here is small (almost no time).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Maven. I already contributed some stuff to Maven Release and Maven SCM. Again, little time for this. For a living i currently develop ETL routes with Camel, Quarkus and OpenShift.
- 📫 How to reach me: Best is still using mail: clemens<<-at->>quoss.de
